    about: "In the increasingly complex landscape of job recruitment, managing the high volume of resumes and diverse job requirements presents significant challenges. Our research addresses these issues by introducing an advanced resume analyzing and job recommendation system that integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) through Spacy. This system excels in accurately extracting and parsing critical resume information, including candidate details, qualifications, and work experience. Additionally, it pioneers the use of video resumes by incorporating visual and audio processing techniques to assess candidates' presentation skills and qualifications comprehensively. Experimental results confirm the systemâ€™s effectiveness, demonstrating high accuracy in information retrieval and showcasing its potential to revolutionize the recruitment process by merging traditional resume parsing with innovative video analysis.",

This project involves using React for the front-end to create a dynamic user interface where users can input long URLs and receive shortened versions. Node.js, along with Express.js, is used for the back-end to handle HTTP requests, process URL shortening logic, and communicate with the MongoDB database, which stores URL mappings. Key features of the application include URL shortening, which converts long URLs into short links; redirection, which ensures that shortened URLs redirect users to the original URLs; link management, allowing users to view and manage their shortened links (if user authentication is implemented); and optional analytics to track the usage and statistics of shortened URLs.",
